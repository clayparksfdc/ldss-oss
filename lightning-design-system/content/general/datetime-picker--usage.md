## Overview

- The datetime picker is a form element that lets you select a date and time in one place.
- Used to schedule events or set time-based records.
- Helps users input date and time accurately, saving time and reducing errors.
- Type a date and time directly or select from the calendar and time dropdown options.
## Usage

The datetime picker is typically used when an application or record requires both a date and time input. It's commonly used for event scheduling, booking appointments, or setting reminders.

### Best Practices

- Use the datetime picker when both date and time are required, such as for scheduled appointments or event planning.
- To simplify input, default to the current date and time as the starting point.
- Show the required format with clear instructions or placeholder text in the input field.
### When Not to Use

- Don't use a datetime picker if only the date or only the time is needed. Instead, use either the date picker or time picker components.
- Don't use the datetime picker for static content that doesn't require user input.

-**Medium (default):** Set `date-style="medium"` to display the date in a medium-length style, such as Jan 7, 2025 in the en-US locale.
- **Short:** Set `date-style="short”` to display a short style such as 1/7/2025.
- **Long:** Set `date-style="long"` to display a long style such as January 7, 2025.

Medium (default): Set date-style="medium" to display the date in a medium-length style, such as Jan 7, 2025 in the en-US locale.

Short: Set date-style="short” to display a short style such as 1/7/2025.

Long: Set date-style="long" to display a long style such as January 7, 2025.

#### Labels

- **Field label:** Use title capitalization without end punctuation. If the UI design lacks a visible label, a hidden text label or offscreen field label is required for accessibility.
- **Field caption:**Use a phrase or a full sentence without end punctuation.
-**Use a field caption in these situations:**

If a label alone doesn't clearly define a field or a fieldset, you can include a field caption with a field label or with the field itself.
- To convey information that’s critical to the use of a field.
- **Don’t use a field caption in these situations:**

If the field label is clear enough to define the field.
- To convey noncritical information without sending users to a help page. In that case, use an infobubble instead.

#### Placeholder text

- Placeholder text is optional, and can be included to give context or help the user know what to enter into the field.
- Use sentence capitalization. Unless the text ends with a question mark, end it with an ellipsis.
- Use a friendly tone but be concise, and keep in mind that localization of labels sometimes makes them longer.
- In type-ahead and autofill fields, results show up as you type. Use standard placeholder text such as “Search this field…”
- All fields require a field label, even if they have placeholder text. If the UI design lacks a visible label, include an offscreen label for accessibility.
